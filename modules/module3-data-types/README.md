# Module 3: Data Types

## Core Module

## Learning Objectives

- Master Rust's struct and enum data structures
- Learn how to implement methods and associated functions
- Understand pattern matching and its applications
- Work with option and result types for error handling

## Content Summary

This module covers Rust's custom data types, including structs and enums, which are fundamental to writing organized and type-safe code in Rust. You'll learn how to define and use these types, implement methods, and leverage Rust's powerful pattern matching capabilities.

## Topics Covered

- Structs
- Enums
- Pattern Matching

## Exercises

In the [exercises](./exercises/) directory, you'll find practice problems to reinforce these concepts:

1. **Library System** - Create a library management system using structs and methods
2. **Error Handling** - Practice using Option and Result types for robust error handling
