# Module 2: Memory Management

## Core Module

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Rust's ownership system and its rules
- Learn how to use references and borrowing
- Master Rust's approach to memory safety without garbage collection
- Work with different data types and understand their memory characteristics

## Content Summary

This module covers Rust's unique approach to memory management through ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. You'll learn how Rust ensures memory safety at compile time without needing a garbage collector.

## Topics Covered

- Memory Concepts
- Ownership
- Borrowing
- Slices

## Exercises

In the [exercises](./exercises/) directory, you'll find practice problems to reinforce these concepts:

1. **Ownership Practice** - Identify and fix ownership issues in code samples
2. **Borrowing Challenge** - Refactor code to use references properly
3. **Slice Workshop** - Work with various slice types to solve problems
4. **Memory Management Debugging** - Find and fix memory-related bugs
