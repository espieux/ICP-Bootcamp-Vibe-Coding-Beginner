# Module 5: Collections

## Core Module

## Learning Objectives

- Master Rust's common collection types (vectors, strings, hash maps)
- Learn how to efficiently store, access, and modify collections of data
- Understand ownership and borrowing in the context of collections
- Apply collections to solve real-world problems

## Content Summary

This module covers Rust's standard collection types, which are essential for storing and manipulating groups of data. You'll learn the characteristics, performance implications, and best practices for using vectors, strings, and hash maps in your Rust programs.

## Topics Covered

- Vectors
- Strings
- Hash Maps

## Exercises

In the [exercises](./exercises/) directory, you'll find practice problems to reinforce these concepts:

1. **Collection Manipulation** - Practice working with vectors, strings, and hash maps

## Final Challenge

After completing this module, you're ready to tackle the [Rust Mini-Project Challenge](./exercises/final_challenge/README.md) - a comprehensive exercise that combines concepts from all core modules.
